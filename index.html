+ Our homeland has become the den of crime and corruption.
+ Hijackers, robbers, kidnappers, rapists, drug cartels, extortionists, and murderers. In every alley, every highway, every market, a terror envelops our lives.
+ When a victim dares to seek justice, she faces a cruel theatre:
---+ Handed back to the criminals by the very officials she sought justice to.
---+ Absorbed dry of her family’s wealth by officials who promise action but deliver none.
---+ Ignored entirely if the victim is poor, for justice has become too costly.
---+ In rare cases, justice is partly served — but only after decades, due to the scumbag maze of the legislative structure.
+ Patriotic, honest officials are severely outnumbered and systematically rendered ineffective.
+ Crimes are bred, financed, and protected by the highest chairs of power — politicians, businessmen, and state officials.
+ The source of their wealth and power is the very earnings of us general people.
+ The politicians and officials fill up their pockets with the tax from our hard-earned money. Police and RAB forces — the vanguards of crime and tyranny — are armed with the very earnings of ours. VATs and deliberate price hikes keep the terror-lord businessmen sustained. We work like a machine, sweating days and nights in a city so suffocating with pollution, crowd, and chaos, only to finance our and fellow countrymen’s misery.
~
+ When the blow comes, there is no single authority to trust.
+ No single neighbour to get help from. People enjoy other’s victimization as if it were a street play.
+ Completely helpless, we must wait for the day a wife is gang-raped and murdered in front of her husband; a son turns into a coke addict; a daughter is found hanging from a rope; aged parents are found dead in a house robbery; one is lethally injured trying to resist a hijacking; and every penny they have earned with the sweat of brow is gone bribing the officials for justice and navigating the labyrinth of the court system.
+ If you don't stand up, form a true "WE," and keep enjoying the misery of a fellow, it will be your turn soon.
+ If we don't confront the bully, the bully will confront us.
+ Let us be awakened and aware. Let us be united, brave, and civilized.
+ Let the power be to the people.
